The Benefits of an #AudioNFT Release
Let's say you're a musician with a few tracks released on Spotify, iTunes, and all of the popular streaming platforms. You promote your release, the project drops, you get thousands of hits and a few monthly listeners. The fiscal quarter ends and your traffic numbers look good, but your revenue looks really really bad. According to this Spotify Royalty Calculator it would take 100,000 streams to make around $400... That's not much at all. You could even go viral and hit 2 million streams, you're only going to take home less than $8,000. These aren't exactly the "fat stacks" that'll make you quit your hustle and retire your parents, but if you're kicking ass on all of the major platforms then things could add up pretty nicely. With Audio NFT's things work a little differently. You aren't being paid per-stream, you're being paid per edition. Think of it kind of like the digital version of a rare limited edition vinyl record release. You mint your audio token to the blockchain complete with album art and a high quality mp3. You determine how many editions you would like to make permanently available, then you release it on a marketplace. Instead of charging $1 USD for a downloadable single to an unlimited amount of people, you could charge .15 ETH (worth about $77 at the moment) for 1 of 15 available tokens. In the end you could potentially make close to $1155 for the direct sales of 15 digital files that you don't have to worry about hosting, tracking, or sending. You could then liquidate your $1155 in ETH and use the cash to fund your full project. No waiting for quarterly payouts and no chasing record labels for checks. Then depending on how you sold your NFT, you could instantly get a percentage of sales every time that NFT is resold. Simply put, Audio NFT's are a way to turn your digital music files into digital collectibles that can appreciate in value over time.
