			<p class="text-9xl font-bold ml-40 mt-10"> Guidelines </p>
			
			<p class="text-2xl ml-40 mt-10 mr-80"> Diskify is a new environment for musicians to bind with their fans. For maintaining the good vibes within this community, we have defined some rules. </p>

			<p class="text-4xl ml-40 mt-10 mr-80 font-bold"> Creators </p>

				<p class="text-xl ml-40 mt-10 mr-80"> We are inspired and happy to allow many creators to have a new way of connecting with fans. We supervalue the respect with other creators and their work. </p>

				<p class="text-xl ml-40 mt-10 mr-80"> Any creator is welcome! </p>
				
				<p class="text-xl ml-40 mt-10 mr-80"> If you have any doubts, you can contact us in our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/guhhammer/" class="text-blue-500 mr-2 hover:text-gray-400 italic"> instagram.</a></p>
				
				<p class="text-xl ml-40 mt-10 mr-80"> We check every artist work before releasing them, so we can verify and be sure that there is no plagiarism. </p>

				<p class="text-xl ml-40 mt-10 mr-80"> It is important to us to allow the artists to be free and original in their work. </p>
				
				<p class="text-xl ml-40 mt-10 mr-80"> When you upload your album on Diskify, you will maintain legal rights and can reproduce and exhibit it. </p>

				<p class="text-xl ml-40 mt-10 mr-80"> You can't upload other artists' work or make more NFTs representing the same album (related albums including previous tracks are ok). </p>

			<p class="text-4xl ml-40 mt-10 mr-80 font-bold"> Fans </p>

				<p class="text-xl ml-40 mt-10 mr-80"> When you acquire an NFT on Diskify, you own the album represented by it -- which allows you to download the album to your smartphone on the diskify app and listen to the tracks in it. (You can also resell it). </p>

				<p class="text-xl ml-40 mt-10 mr-80"> When you buy an album with us, you will not have the intellectual property rights of the work. You can't reproduce and sell the tracks in the album, make changes to the work or make NFTs representing the same artwork.</p>
